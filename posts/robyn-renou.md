Once, on Earth, there was a fungus called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. It grew in the rainforests and would infect the Camponotini ant, sending tendrils of mycelia drilling into its brain. It would take over the neurons and force the ant to leave its work and climb the nearest plant, affixing itself with its mandibles. For a few days, the fungus would just sit and grow. Eventually, it would burst from the head - a long, thin sprouting organ that when ready would rain thousands of deadly spores on the ants below.

Once, on a far distant planet, a fungus evolved that did something similar to meat containers. The fungus - Ophiocordyceps mons - grew slowly in the brain over a decade or so. As it did, it released an ever-so-slowly increasing dose of psilocybin. Its hosts described it as a decade of slow descent into strangeness. Some even sought it out - as was the case of the painter Robyn Renou.

Robyn had been born at the foot of the great mountain Typis. It was an awe-striking sight. Three times as large as Everest, it stabbed like a great jagged spear into the purple sky. Its shadow stretched across the surface of the planet like a great tear in the horizon. Robyn had always loved to paint. And now, with the dose of psilocybin constantly generated in eir brain, eir landscapes had become more vibrant than ever before. More abstracted. More experimental.

Ey had heard ey were famous, but ey didn't care all that much. Ey hadn't left eir home town in quite a few cycles, and it was how ey liked it. The best weeks were spent hiking along the tracks with eir equipment. Ey would find some new vista, some new sight, and set up camp for a few days. Ey would paint and smoke, and drink wine, and if the weather was good ey would strip off eir clothes and live naked.

Eir paintings started as fairly realistic renderings of the untouched mountains, the trees that had been bred an orangey color, their leaves flushed with a rich infra-red hue that absorbed the shifted sunlight best. The magnetic field here was intense and every night there was a fireworks show across the electromagnetic spectrum. Renou tried to capture as much of that spectrum as possible, painting into the infrared and ultraviolet range, even touching the low microwaves with some of eir more experimental pigments. Perhaps even a speckle of radioactive isotope across a prepared canvas, to show some streaking comet across the sky in all its incandescent glory. Ey had inherited eir eyes from Grandfather when ey was sixteen, the moment eir skull had been big enough.

As the fungal condition progressed, Renou's landscapes became less realistic. More fragmented, more distorted, and more space between eir eyes' interface with the optic nerve and eir hand acting upon the canvas. More connections passed through on the way.

As the fungal condition progressed, the trips lengthened and lengthened, until eir partners wouldn't expect em home for weeks. Ey would return eventually, whistling and humming and covered from head to toe in little flecks of paint.

Until, one day, ey saw the mountain and it was different. There was a gateway at its peak, a gateway to some other world. Some different plane. It shone with a terrifying brilliance and Renou could only gasp and tear at eir hair and gather eir things for the journey, heading off upwards with shouts and whispers. After a few days, ey had climbed emselves ragged, the hardest ey had ever tried. Ey had left their paints, eir tent, eir food, a while back. Ey stumbled and staggered up the mountain until the landscape stretched below them, curving away into the distance, the great turquoise asteroid ring stretching from one part of the horizon to the other.

Eventually, eir body gave out and ey collapsed on the harsh and sterile rocks of the higher reaches of the mountain where biological life had only just begun to take seed. Ey sat on the mountain, slack-jawed, staring out at the sunset and sunrise. Renou was still for days, eir eyes never moving, looking out, out, at the picture in front of em. Every part of the spectrum glittering in eir mind's eye.

A sprouting flower burst from eir forehead. A thick stem, growing, pushing eir skull aside as the fungus consumed all of Renou's brain and body for its rapid growth. Renou's eyes - any consciousness long-gone - bloomed into a garden. Eir body blossomed into new life, eir skin splitting and countless new forms of mycology emerging from underneath.

The wind came, and an enormous cloud of spores took flight on it. Millions of them were carried on the wind for hundreds of kilometers. When they found the body, they burned it where it lay.
