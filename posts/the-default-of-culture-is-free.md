So artificial intelligence got pretty good in 2022, huh? Specifically, it improved quite a bit at *creating things*. This newfound ability of generative art has sparked a range of hostile responses, some of which I think is fairly well-founded and all of which I think are worth discussing. After all, creative endeavours are perhaps our most emotionally guarded skillset as an intelligent species. The current mimicry of large generative models forces us to reconsider the very nature of culture and the things that generate it.

2021 was the year of the low-resolution vaguely-recognisable GAN image generators and GPT3. They weren't terrible, but they also were clearly limited. Remember when [DALL-E 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E) was impressive? Well, how quickly times change.

2022 was the year of [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/), and many more tools that allowed widespread public access to models which could generate far better AI art than had been previously seen. This rapid improvement has continued into 2023.

# Culture As A Domain

One aspect of generative AI which I think makes us uncomfortable is its framing of culture as a _domain_, i.e. a set of all possible outputs from an algorithm. That is not to say the idea of the cultural domain is completely alien to us - often, upon seeing a new painting, we might compare it to existing output by saying something wanky like "the sky is very Van Gogh" or "it's got a Monet sort of feeling". But it is one thing to place a work within this domain - it is another thing to have that landscape, or a version of it, laid out in front of you. It can be somewhat disheartening to feel as if your work is merely placing a marker upon a fixed landscape of variables, and not the creation of something truly new.

What do we lose when we perceive culture as a continous domain upon which a near-infinite number of artistic works can be explored? For one thing such a lens does not permit (or at least encourage) curation. When any articulable thought can be quickly synthesized into a mimicry of creativity, we inevitably end up with a lot of artefacts that no human would have ever bothered to create.

However, it is important to recognise that the lens of the domain is not as restrictive as a first glance gives. We must remember, after all, that we have been growing this domain for all of recorded history. The glory of consciousness is in its irreducibility to simpler probabilistic models. While AI may be able to add dimensions of its own to our cultural domain, I think we have a significant amount of surprises up our sleeves that no AI trained on all of our culture would be able to predict.

# Everything Is Property (but it doesn't have to be)

The civilization that we have built ourselves demands that we view everything within it as property to be commodified. This extends into our culture. Characters, chord progressions, extended universes, brands, institutions - each are traded as common objects amongst commercial enterprises.
