Sean is a high-functioning sack of sapient flesh, consisting mostly of complex proteins and water. He was born in 1992 – on time and under budget – in Sydney, Australia. He's lived in Melbourne, Santiago, Lima, Sydney and Bristol. His current location is: Melbourne.

Sean enjoys programming, art, philosophy, writing, politics, and trying to find ways to ramble about all of those things whenever he can. He is almost always incorrect, but that never stops him having an opinion.

All thoughts, statements and opinions found herein are entirely that of a CIA chip implanted in Sean’s head in 1998 during a particularly unpleasant dentist’s visit, and do not reflect the opinions of whoever is currently foolish enough to fund his Steam library.

Sean is trying to make something beautiful. If you think you can help, or need help yourself, let him know.
