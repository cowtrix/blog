Sean is a high-functioning sack of sapient flesh, consisting mostly of complex proteins and water. He was born in 1992 – on time and under budget – in Sydney, Australia. He's lived in Melbourne, Santiago, Lima, Sydney and Bristol. His current location is: Melbourne.

Sean enjoys programming, art, philosophy, writing, politics, and trying to find ways to ramble about all of those things whenever he can. He is almost always incorrect, but that never stops him having an opinion.

All thoughts, statements and opinions found herein are entirely that of a CIA chip implanted in Sean’s head in 1998 during a particularly unpleasant dentist’s visit, and do not reflect the opinions of whoever is currently foolish enough to fund his Steam library.

Sean is trying to make something beautiful. If you think you can help, or need help yourself, let him know.

# Projects

Despite having the attention span of a particularly spaced-out hamster, I do manage to make some things occasionally. Here is where I track the general existence and progress of these various projects.

## Released Games

If my name's on the credits, I'm taking credit.
### [Hurtworld](/hurtworld)

![](/Hurtworld.jpg)

2014 - 2018

Myself and a small team made Hurtworld, an open-world multiplayer survival game for PC, Mac and Linux. My role here involved touching most aspects of design and programming, such as networking, UI design, tools creation, and the creation of multiple complex runtime systems.

### Frostbite Engine (EA)

2021 - Present

NHL 22, FIFA 22, Battlefield 2042, Madden 22, NHL 23, FIFA 23, Madden 23, NFS Unbound, Dead Space (remaster), UFC 5, Madden 24, FC24, NHL 24, PGA Tour

I build developer tooling for the Frostbite engine team at Electronic Arts. It's been a cool experience. How many people can say they've built tools from scratch for a company of thousands that are heavily used? Anyway, scroll down right to the end of the credits. I'll be there somewhere.

## Games Tools

I like making things that make things. When I can, I also like sharing these tools as open source.

### [PlayStation Debug Tools](https://www.snsystems.com/)

![](SNSystems.png)

Working on Sony's current and next-generation console platform, providing tools to developers including compilers, debuggers, analyzers, and more.
### [Mad Maps](/mad-maps)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cowtrix/Mad-Maps/refs/heads/master/Branding/Logo.png)

Mad Maps was a Unity tool spun-off from the Hurtworld project. Its a level development pipeline for combining procedural and handcrafted content non-destructively.

### [Voxul](/voxul)

Voxul is a voxel framework and editor tool for Unity. It consists of both a runtime framework for handling and rendering voxel data, and an editor tool for painting and modifying voxel data from within the engine.

### [Muzak](/muzak)

Muzak is a Unity tool for creating generative music. Kind of like if you gave a state machine access to a loop pedal.

### [zSplines](https://github.com/cowtrix/zSplines)

A spline tool for Unity.

### Dodo

When I was living the UK, I got involved with Extinction Rebellion. I spent quite a while working on a tool for organising environmental events across the globe called Dodo, basically building a little team across the UK of volunteer coders. Unfortunately the project didn't reach completion as Extinction Rebellion decided to use a 3rd party solution instead, but it was a great experience of collaboratively building a team and project.

### Asset Library

An editor tool for managing semantic asset labels. Use it to easily manage metadata about your assets, tagging them with any amount of labels that can then be filtered and searched through.
