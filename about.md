Sean is a high-functioning sack of sapient flesh, consisting mostly of complex proteins and water. He was born in 1992 – on time and under budget – in Sydney, Australia. He's lived in Melbourne, Santiago, Lima, Sydney and Bristol. His current location is: Melbourne.

Sean enjoys programming, art, philosophy, writing, politics, and trying to find ways to ramble about all of those things whenever he can. He is almost always incorrect, but that never stops him having an opinion.

All thoughts, statements and opinions found herein are entirely that of a CIA chip implanted in Sean’s head in 1998 during a particularly unpleasant dentist’s visit, and do not reflect the opinions of whoever is currently foolish enough to fund his Steam library.

Sean is trying to make something beautiful. If you think you can help, or need help yourself, let him know.

# Projects

Despite having the attention span of a particularly spaced-out hamster, I do manage to make some things occasionally. Here is where I track the general existence and progress of these various projects.

| Myself and a small team made Hurtworld, an open-world multiplayer survival game for PC, Mac and Linux. My role here involved touching most aspects of design and programming, such as networking, UI design, tools creation, and the creation of multiple complex runtime systems. | I build developer tooling for the Frostbite engine team at Electronic Arts. It's been a cool experience. How many people can say they've built tools from scratch for a company of thousands that are heavily used? Anyway, scroll down right to the end of the credits. I'll be there somewhere. |

## Games Tools

I like making things that make things. When I can, I also like sharing these tools as open source.
